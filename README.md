# Welcome to my portfolio!

This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU.

# About me
My name is Demitra Kourtzidis (she/her pronouns). I am a first-year student in the Master of Science in Public Policy and Management (MSPPM) program at Carnegie Mellon. I decided to study public policy because I am passionate about criminal justice reform, and I decided to study public policy at CMU because I think the mascot (plaid) is inspiring. 

I got my bachelor's degree in political science from Eastern Connecticut State University with minors in economics and Spanish. My thesis was a qualitative analysis of criminal justice reform efforts in three states: Massachusetts, Oregon, and Louisiana. 
I also studied abroad in Costa Rica. While there, I bungee jumped and got bitten by a species of fly that can cause a disease called river blindness. I did not contract the disease. My Spanish has gotten really rusty, so let me know if anyone wants to practice with me. 

# What I Hope to Learn

There are too many political problems in this country to name, but I believe many of them stem from experts' inability to communicate high-level information to laypeople. That makes their expertise not-so-useful, politically. I'm taking this class because I want to be able to communicate complex ideas in accessible, interesting ways. Maybe my heaping debt will be worth it if I can save western democracy.

There is so much information at our fingertips that most of us block it all out. I think interesting and simple images can break through that barrier of overwhelm to spread ideas farther and faster. This is especially relevant to criminal justice reform because American culture is punitive. To eliminate mass incarceration, we have to change the policies. To change the policies, we have to change the culture. Images just might be the key to doing that.
